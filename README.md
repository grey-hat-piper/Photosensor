# Photosensor Proteus Simulation
This simulation is based on a final year Electrical Engineering Project, 
Photoelectric sensor for vegetation detection under a Power line:

1. Move all the component(Uno, GSM, Sensor) library files to the Proteus Library folder - (Localdisk\\Program Files (x86)\Labcenter Electronics\Proteus 8 Professional\DATA\LIBRARY)

2. Open Proteus simulation workspace file(.pdsprj), double-click on microcontroller(Uno) and copy '.hex' file path where 'Program File' is required

3. Finally, you can run the simulation
